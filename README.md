# calc-it
A calculator project created during [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum which showcases my understanding of HTML, CSS, and Vanilla Javascript.


## Description
A calculator that runs basic math operators such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
It allows you to evaluate a pair of (x, y) values together.
All results and inputs are displayed on the calculator screen.
Decimal numbers are limited up to 3 decimal places.

The calculator has the ability to clear all history and backspace.

Division by zero will give you an interesting message.

## What I learned
I learned how to plan out the workflow of the project. I kept track of bugs and tested edge cases in order to solve them. I placed an emphasis on code readability and ensured the purpose of each function is clear and concise. Improved string methods and DOM Manipulation understanding.
